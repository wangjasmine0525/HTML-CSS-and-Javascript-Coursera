# HTML, CSS and Javascript Coursera

In this introduction to HTML/CSS and Javascript Coursera course, I learned basic HTML/CSS and Javascript to create mini websites by going through five different modules. For my final project, I coded a replicate of the David Chu's China Bistro website. This course was a lot of fun and a great way to stay busy over the summer! Thank you Yaakov Chaikin for this course. 

To access the mini projects search "https://wangjasmine0525.github.io/HTML-CSS-and-Javascript-Coursera/module2-solution/" and replace "module#-solution" with the appropriate module number.
